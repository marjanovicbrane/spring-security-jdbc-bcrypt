# We created a new app with SPRING SECURITY, using JDBC AUTHENTICATION with BCRYPT algorithm for passwords.In our database we have 2 tables, authorities and users.We also created 4 config classes, because we are using pure java configs, no xml.Two config classes are for SPRING SECURITY because we are using now JDBC AUTHENTICATION and we also added some ROLES for our CUSTOM LOGIN PAGE which we created with bootstrap.We have 3 roles, EMPLOYEE, MANAGER and ADMIN.Based on those roles user can see appropriate HOME PAGE with links only for user with employee role, manager or admin.We are also using CSRF TOKEN by default, because of SPRING FILTERS.
